# 1 Use-Case Name: Edit Settings

## 1.1 Brief Description
There will be many different possibilities of adjusting the game according to a user's wishes. In order to let a user change certain settings, a menu is needed in which those settings are adjustable.
When clicking on the "home"- or "pause" button (left at the top), a menu pops up which allows a user to modify settings by clicking on several icons.
For example, there could be some settings for muting the sound or stopping game-animations.
Using the "close"-button right at the top, a user can return to the game.
While being in the settings-menu, the game should be paused.

# 2 Flow of Events
## 2.1 Basic Flow
- user clicks on the "pause"-button
